ANN Handwritten Digit Recognition

My first time learning about neural networks. This project is a neural network using only the NumPy library for handwritten digit recognition. I used the MNIST database.

- `mnist_loader.py` loads the data from MNIST file \
- `network.py` contains all the functionality of the network (initialize weights and biases, feedforward, stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation) \
- `test.py` tests the neural network
- `network2.py` implements techniques (cross-entropy cost function, regularization, better weight initialization) to improve the basic neural network.
