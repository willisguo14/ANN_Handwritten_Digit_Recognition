ANN Handwritten Digit Recognition

Training a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using NumPy. Data is from MNIST database. 

- `mnist_loader.py` loads the data from MNIST file 
- `network.py` contains all the functionality of the network (initialize weights and biases, feedforward, stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation) 
- `test.py` tests the neural network
- `network2.py` implements techniques (cross-entropy cost function, regularization, better weight initialization) to improve the basic neural network.
